/*
A media research team is developing a tool to analyze word frequency 
in large textual datasets, such as news articles and research papers. 
The goal is to process a given paragraph, identify individual words, 
and count their occurrences while ensuring case-insensitive matching. 
Since the tool is intended for both constrained environments and 
high-performance systems, two different approaches are consideredâ€”one 
utilizing dynamic memory management and another relying on manually 
structured arrays.
The first challenge is reading an entire paragraph from the console 
as a single unformatted string. Once acquired, the text must be split 
into individual words, ensuring that uppercase and lowercase variations 
are treated as the same. To store and process words dynamically, the 
team designs mechanism using raw pointers and dynamic memory allocation, 
allowing the program to handle variable input sizes effectively.
In one approach, a dynamically allocated array is used to store words, 
with additional logic to count occurrences efficiently. The array expands 
as needed, ensuring that new words can be accommodated. The frequency 
counting is implemented manually by searching for existing words in the 
array and updating counts accordingly.
