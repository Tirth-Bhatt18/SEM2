/*
A team of software developers was tasked with creating a graphical simulation 
where operations on 2D points play a crucial role. To facilitate this, they 
designed a class Point that encapsulates the coordinates ùë• and ùë¶. The class 
provides flexibility through overloaded operators to manipulate points 
efficiently. The unary operator - is overloaded to negate the coordinates of 
a point, while the binary operator + enables the addition of two points. 
Additionally, the equality operator == is overloaded to compare whether two 
points have identical coordinates.
The development process required performing various operations between multiple 
points. To manage these operations effectively, a mechanism was needed to track 
and potentially undo them. This challenge prompted two approaches: using a 
ready-made dynamic stack structure or building a custom stack implementation. 
By managing a sequence of operations in reverse, the stack-based design allowed 
for a systematic undo capability, crucial for simulations involving iterative adjustments.
